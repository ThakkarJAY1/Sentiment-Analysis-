0,,we have many things that need aa battery they are great
1,,Thankful that I was able to find on Amazon for a great price and even better shipping. Arrived in perfect condition and did exactly what I needed it to. Great purchase and would purchase again.
2,,I don't know if I would buy thus brand again seems like they don't last as long as Duracell
3,,"In my opinion these did not last anywhere near as long as Duracel in things like LED candles (which is crazy) and trail cameras. Cameras were not exposed to cold temps more or less than other batteries. WE buy in bulk for the north house. Amazon Basics is great for things like sheets and beeding and towels. In my opinion the battery life, in the large package of aaa and aa size we purchased were lacking."
4,,this is the worst
5,,Bought these batteries for my Christmas gifts the month of (december) only lasted like 2months toys now need replacement batteries . I also used some for my doorbell and just now needs replacement batteries. Tv Remote control is still working but these batteries don't last very long...
6,,This my second order and they seem to work as good as name brand and ship to my door.
7,,This was my second purchase of amazon batteries and they work great. Just as good or even better than name brand batteries and half the price. This will be the only way I purchase batteries from now on!
8,,They last as long as Duracell batteries in my Xbox one controllers and none of them exploded like some of the reviews said.
9,,they seemed to not last as long as other name brand names disappointed!
10,,These do not last long at all very cheap batteries no happy
11,,have not used yet but a battery is a battery good price
12,,"These Amazon batteries did the job although I gave 4star only because I had a few I would say a hand full of batteries that were not as strong or were pretty weak but out of a box of 48 batteries, I will definitely buy again for this priceIm pretty well satisfied.Thank you!"
13,,We've ordered these a few times cause we've been so happy with product. These are good quality. We are also happy with price. I would recommend these.
14,,HAVE NOT HAD CHANCE TO USE ALL OF THEM BUT HOPEFULLY ALL OF THEM WILL REMAIN IN GOOD ORDER FOR A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME MEANING A FEW YEARS OUT.
15,,"these were under a light we thought they were there to fit the light when they arrived and nice company they were not the batteries we needed it should have been aa but that is ok,it was our fault not knowing this. thanks.."
16,,"I use these batteries in my game cameras and they work great, last several weeks."
17,,Very convenient to have a box of batteries and at a good price. No longer need to compare pricing in stores. Should have done this long time ago.
18,,Not much to say about batteries except they work for a good price. Having a hundred let's me share with kids and grand kids.
19,,They seem to work okay so far and the price was great.
20,,I use them for my Xbox controllers and they last pretty long. Great for a cheap price.
21,,Seem to hold up as well as any name brand and at a much better price
22,,Works just as well as every other brand of battery with a better price. Powers all of my sons toys for months at a time.
23,,Just got them so i really wont kno for a few eeeks or so how good these batteries are
24,,These last as well as Energizer- half the price.
25,,"These batteries are horrible. We depend on AA batteries for many wireless microphone and have found that brand-name batteries last about a month per our usage. We switched to Amazon basics to try it out when a subscription for our preferred brand was no longer available and have found that, under the same usage, these batteries last about a week. That's a 1/4 capacity."
26,,"3rd purchase of these AA from Amazon, all have expiration of 2027. Ones I've used thus far last as Long as name brands"
27,,I am 100 satisfied with my purchase of these batteries
28,,"I put these batteries in 10 of the 12 window candles that I bought - I put my last 2 Duracell in the other 2. The Amazon Batteries lasted for about 10 days and the Duracell lasted for 12. Since then I've experimented to see if this is consistent . It is, the Duracell last an average of 17 longer."
29,,"First time I bought these they worked well and lasted almost as long as the name brands. Not the same this time around, almost no charge - 4-6 hours of run time - Junk batteries."
30,,Seem to work very well at a great price.
31,,These batteries don't last even in a simple digital clock. 2 weeks at best.
32,,"I buy AAA and AA batteries about 4 - 6 times a year. I made the switch to Amazon batteries about 2 years ago and never looked back. These batteries work just as well as any of the name brands, but at a much more reasonable cost."
33,,"Date on the back of these were 1992. Yeah, 1992. Inedible."
34,,"GOT THE 48 PACK, I USEDD THEM UP FASTER THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD!!,SO IM ORDERING MORE !! SO IM ORDERING MORE NOW"
35,,The 48 packs are the lowest price per AA battery you will find anywhere. I have a device I use for work that needs 8 new AA batteries every working day. These batteries get me through a 12 hour day the same as the expensive batteries. I could switch to rechargeable batteries but the simplicity of just putting in new batteries and not fooling with recharging every night is worth it to me.
